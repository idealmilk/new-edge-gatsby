The project uses Node v18 and npm v8, so either download those or have a look at Node version managers such as [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) or [n](https://github/tj/n).

## üöÄ Quick Start

1.  **Install dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

2.  **Start developing**

    Open up a new terminal window back in the root of the gatsby directory and start it up.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`\_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data.

## ü§ù Contributing

- Create a new branch following the format of `[type]/[ticket-number]-[summary]`, for example `feature/NE-update-readme` or `hotfix/NE-0002-fix-readme`.
- Once your work is finished, before deploying make sure to check the gatsby.config and confirm that the correct version of gatsby-plugin-s3 is being used.
- When ready to deploy, push the branch up and open a pull request; don't be afraid to break a feature down into many branches/PRs to make reviewing easier.
- On commit, [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) will run to format the code and ensure it is free from errors.
- Ideally, all new features would come with tests.
